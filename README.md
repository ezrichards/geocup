# GeoCup

I like code, and I like GeoGuessr, so I made a website for the GeoCup!

The **GeoCup** is a mini competition I'm holding with friends over the entire month of April.
We'll be doing one asynchronous challenge link on GeoGuessr _every day_. Move, pan, zoom is
allowed and we're playing with 2 minute rounds on World. Everyone is welcome -- play at [geocup.pages.dev](https://geocup.pages.dev)!

The leaderboard will be updated everyday and the next day's link will be released shortly after. The winner gets something, idk.

To load data, save results from the API URL as json in the `games` folder: `https://www.geoguessr.com/api/v3/results/highscores/GAME_CODE`
