# GeoCup

I like code, and I like GeoGuessr, so I made a website for the GeoCup!

The **GeoCup** is a mini competition I'm holding with friends over the entire month of April.
We'll be doing one asynchronous challenge link on GeoGuessr _every day_. Move, pan, zoom is
allowed and we're playing with 2 minute rounds on World. Everyone is welcome -- play at [geocup.pages.dev](https://geocup.pages.dev)!

The leaderboard will be updated everyday and the next day's link will be released shortly after. The winner gets something, idk.
