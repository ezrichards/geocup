# GeoCup

I like code, and I like GeoGuessr, so I made a website for the GeoCup! 

The **GeoCup** is a mini competition I'm holding with friends over the entire month of April.
We'll be doing one asynchronous challenge link on GeoGuessr *every day*. Move, pan, zoom is
allowed and we're playing with 2 minute rounds on World.
